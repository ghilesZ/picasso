# Picasso
Picasso is an Abstract element drawing library which provides several
ways of drawing abstract element. As abstract elements may be
unbounded, and are generally defined on more than 2 dimensions,
rendering them in a 2d context can be difficult.

### Different backends
- interactive Gtk window (scrollable, zoomable) 
- LaTex generation
- 3D .obj file generation (todo)
- Non-interractive graphics window (todo)
