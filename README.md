# Picasso
Picasso is an Abstract element drawing library which provides several
ways of drawing abstract element. As abstract elements may be
unbounded, and are generally defined on more than 2 dimensions,
rendering them in a 2d context can be difficult.  Picasso handles most
of the boilerplate you usually write to draw abstract elements and
allows you to view thos with minimum effort from your end.
